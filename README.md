# RTOS
```
The real-time operating system (RTOS) that has been implemented is designed to provide efficient
task scheduling and synchronization for embedded systems. This RTOS incorporates key features
such as preemption, round-robin scheduling, as well as support for mutexes, counting semaphores,
and mailboxes. These features enable the system to handle concurrent tasks, prioritize critical
operations, and ensure efficient resource sharing.

Preemption, a fundamental feature of this RTOS, allows tasks to be interrupted and preempted
by higher-priority tasks. This mechanism ensures that critical tasks can be executed in a
timely manner, even in the presence of lower-priority tasks. By allowing tasks to be preempted,
the RTOS significantly enhances responsiveness and enables the system to meet stringent
real-time requirements.

Another important scheduling mechanism integrated into this RTOS is round-robin scheduling.
Round-robin ensures fair allocation of CPU time among tasks of equal priority. Each task is
granted a fixed time slice or quantum, after which the next task in the queue is executed.
This approach prevents any single task from monopolizing the CPU and ensures a balanced
distribution of processing time.

To facilitate synchronization and resource sharing, this RTOS incorporates synchronization
primitives such as mutexes, counting semaphores, and mailboxes. Mutexes provide mutual
exclusion, allowing only one task to access a shared resource at a time. Counting semaphores
enable synchronization between multiple tasks by allowing a specified number of tasks to access
a shared resource simultaneously. Mailboxes provide a communication mechanism between tasks,
allowing them to exchange data and messages in a controlled manner.

By combining preemption, round-robin scheduling, and synchronization mechanisms, this RTOS
provides a reliable and efficient platform for concurrent task execution in embedded systems.
It offers the ability to meet real-time constraints, prioritize critical operations, and ensure
the proper use of shared resources. With these features,the implemented RTOS offers a robust
foundation for building complex, responsive, and reliable embedded applications.

## Telematics Unit
### Getting Started
```
- In a Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) project, a NodeMCU-based telematics unit can be used to
  download firmware updates wirelessly from a remote server
- To download firmware updates from a remote server, the NodeMCU must first connect
  to a Wi-Fi network.
  Once connected, the NodeMCU can use standard communication protocols such as HTTP or
  MQTT to communicate with the remote server and check if any update is available or not,
  if it found it will download the firmware update as a hex file. The NodeMCU can store the
  firmware update in its internal flash memory or external storage such as an SD card or EEPROM.
- Once the firmware update is downloaded, the NodeMCU can initiate the update process on
  the target device using the bootloader.
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- gcc
- make
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/FOTA.git
```
2. Navigate to the telematics folder in the terminal and compile the telematics.c
   to generate the executable.
3. Set the Wifi SSID PASSWORD, Url of check file, and Url of update hex file inside the telematics.c 
## Server
### Getting Started
```
- The server is responsible for hosting the firmware updates and making them available to
  the remote devices. This can be done by storing the firmware updates on a file server,
- Server in our case contains to files
  check_file: to hold the version of the update
  update_file: to hold the update in for of hex
```
## Bootloader
### Getting Started
```
- This is the bootloader that will be used to receive and burn the Hex File sent
  from the telematics unit.
- It is not permissible to receive a Hex record before analyzing and burning the previous one.
- The bootloader comprises the MCAL layer that includes the drivers of the MCU, and an APP layer
  that contains the software components of the application.
- The Interface Module receives the Hex File record by record and sends it to the Parser Module.
- The Parser Module analyzes the Hex record, performs checksum, converts the Hex record from
  ASCII to Hex, sets endianess, and sends the binary instructions to the Burner Module.
- The Burner Module burns and verifies the binary instructions in the internal flash.
```
#### Prerequisites:
```
- arm-none-eabi-gcc
- make
- st-flash
- gdb-multiarch
- openocd
```
#### Installation:
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/GomaaMohamed/UART_Bootloader.git
```
2. Modify the path of the project home in the bootloader's makefile.
3. Set the memory boundaries in the linker.ld file.
4. Navigate to the bootloader folder in the terminal and compile the application to generate the executable.
```
$ make all
"This will create a binary executable named app.hex, which is the bootloader executable."
```
5. burn the bootloader
```
$ make flash
```
### Usage
1. To build the Project
```
$ make all
```
2. To clean the Project
```
$ make clean
```
3. To erase the Flash
```
$ make erase
```
4. To burn the Project
```
$ make flash
```
5. To debug the Project
```
$ ./openport
  "This bash script will launch OpenOCD to establish a remote Telnet port on the target"
$ ./startgdb ./app.elf
  "This bash script will initiate a debugging session using gdb-multiarch."
